Hey Guys!
This is our official domain for now.
I have been constantly trying to call Shweta and Noel, but you guys haven't been picking up the call.
And Alisha, I spoke to you, but somethings have changed up.
And that is what I am going to explain.

There has been a subtle change in plan. 
Or...as I think it is...
IMPROVISATION!
What we earlier were supposed to do were to make the charts, the videos, and all and process the campaigns.

But...
NOW I THINK this a better option, because we will be saved from all the movements and hustle that we have.

NOEL!!...SHWETA!!
Please contact me asap, if you think of this plan as being stupid....
Because, we will need to make preparations for the earlier, if this is not the way you like.
Or if you guys have some new idea....just bring it up!
Its extremely necessary now to know all opinions..
